  We chose to make our website for a local client, Eskimo Kisses.
  It is a snow cone business run by a teacher at our school and 
  her husband. The website was designed to expose their presence
  to the general public. With that in mind, the website needed 
  a professional tailor, but it still needed a fun (if slightly
  eccentric) style. We were given a pre-made logo to use, and 
  our client selected a color scheme and communicated it to us 
  via email. We tried to stay as true as possible to her 
  prismatic choice, but eventually, we had to stray slightly
  for stylistic purposes. We stayed in constant touch with 
  the client throughout the design process, and most decisions
  regarding the look of the website were communicated to us 
  directly by the client during those meetings. As an example of
  this, our designed menu and contact form were at her request.
	
  As for the partitioning of responsibility, it was divided up 
  by ability, time, and availability. If one was better at a 
  particular job, it would fall to that individual or vice versa.
  If one was too busy to deal with a situation, the other would
  take it. This system worked well; it was efficient and simplistic.
  The only real issue we encountered was that, initially, 
  when working with CSS all on a single page, we kept accidentally
  overwriting one anotherâ€™s changes. This was a vexing problem; 
  one minute our changes were in place; the next, our changes 
  would be gone. So, as a way of combating this problem, we used
  multiple CSS style sheets, and when the time came to upload, 
  we recombined them.
  
  As a team, we complemented each other well; one of us
  (Nick Earls) did the majority of the HTML and baseline
  styling; the other (Shane Elder) did the menu, form, and
  the majority of the CSS styling.
